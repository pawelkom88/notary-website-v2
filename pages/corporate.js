            Dealing with an instruction from a corporate body means that the notary must properly
            identify both the individuals and the company. Great care is essential at every stage to
            minimise the risks of errors, omissions, alterations, fraud, forgery or money
            laundering.

              After reviewing the instructions and documents, the notary will advise you on the
              formalities required for completing the notarial certificates. However, they will not
              be able to advise you on the overall nature of the transactions that are to take
              effect in the receiving jurisdiction.

              When there are any overseas lawyers or legal advisors involved in the matter, you
              should provide the notary with their contact details and any covering correspondence

              any specific directions for execution.

            <p className="paragraph">
              Once the notary is satisfied with the presented documents and information, a meeting
              will be arranged. During the appointment the notary will verify the identity of all
              signatories and the company and confirm that there is a validly granted authority to
              sign on behalf of the company.

            <p className="paragraph">
              The notary will then ensure that the document is correctly executed and draft and

              Most notarised documents require legalisation by the FCDO or the Consulate of the
              country that the documents are for. Legalisation is the official confirmation that a
              signature, seal or stamp on a document is genuine.

            <br />
            <p className="paragraph">
              If the legislation is required by the receiving jurisdiction, the notary will advise
